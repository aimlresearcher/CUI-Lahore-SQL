CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName NVARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName NVARCHAR(50),
    CourseID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Courses(CourseID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

In this example, the foreign key constraint in the Students table ensures that the CourseID values i
n the Students table correspond to valid CourseID values in the Courses table, maintaining referential integrity. 
The ON DELETE CASCADE specifies that if a course is deleted from the Courses table, all related student records will be automatically deleted as well.
